Radiated Power Simulation

This code simulates the percentage of radiated power from four base stations using the Monte Carlo method. The code generates random points within a square area and counts the number of points that fall inside each base station's circular range. The percentage of radiated power is estimated by dividing the number of points inside the circular range by the total number of generated points.
